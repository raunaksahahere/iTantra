 * Which model carries which language pair.

 * `en-indic` (English into any Indian language) and `indic-en` (the reverse). There is no
 * Indian-to-Indian model small enough for a phone, so Tamil → Hindi goes Tamil → English →
 * Hindi. The reader is told when that happened: a pivoted translation passes through two
 * models and deserves to be read with that in mind.
