/**
 * Decides how far a message or a peer is allowed to be considered "in range".
 *
 * Hybrid by design (see docs/PRD.md §Range):
 *  - **Hop count is the floor and always applies.** It works with no GPS at all, which
 *    is the case that matters most — collapsed buildings, basements, indoor structures.
 *  - **GPS only tightens the boundary**, never widens it, and only when the receiver has
 *    a live fix *and* the message carried origin coordinates. A missing fix silently
 *    falls back to hop count rather than dropping traffic.
 *
 * Hop count is an approximation of distance, not a guaranteed kilometre figure: a BLE
 * hop can be 10 m indoors or 100 m across open ground. Anything user-facing should say
 * "about N hops away", not a distance.
