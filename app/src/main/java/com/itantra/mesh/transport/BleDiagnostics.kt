/**
 * Single source of truth for "why is discovery not working", under one logcat tag.
 *
 * Discovery can fail at three points that look identical from the outside — the peer list is
 * empty either way — so each is recorded separately:
 *
 *  1. **Advertising never started.** `startAdvertising` is fire-and-forget; the only truth is
 *     the [AdvertiseCallback], and several guard conditions return before the call is even
 *     made. Both are recorded here, with the reason.
 *  2. **Nothing was heard.** Raw scan results are counted *before* any service-UUID filtering,
 *     so "the radio heard nothing" is distinguishable from "we heard things and threw them
 *     away".
 *  3. **The scan callback is silently dead.** Android can stop delivering results with no
 *     `onScanFailed` at all. The heartbeat prints the scanner's believed state next to the
 *     time since the last raw result, which is what exposes that case.
 *
 * Filter logcat on the tag [TAG] to get all three in one stream.
