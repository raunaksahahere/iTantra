/**
 * Lifecycle of distress announcements (docs/PRD.md §SOS).
 *
 * An announcement is a broadcast with no recipient. Every phone that holds a live one
 * keeps re-announcing it to peers it has newly met, so someone who walks into range an
 * hour later still learns about it — this is what makes the mesh useful for search and
 * rescue rather than only for people already connected.
 *
 * Two costs are deliberately bounded:
 *  - **Time:** an announcement stops propagating [LIFETIME_MS] after it was created, by
 *    wall clock at the origin, so a stale distress call cannot circulate forever.
 *  - **Airtime:** re-announcement is on a [REANNOUNCE_INTERVAL_MS] tick and only fires
 *    when there are peers that have not already been told. Continuous rebroadcast would
 *    scale badly on a phone relaying several announcements at once.
