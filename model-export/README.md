# iTantra model export

How the on-device speech models are produced and installed.

STT needs no export — verified int8 ONNX already exists (see §3). Only TTS is built here.

---

## 1. What is already done

Hindi and English TTS are exported and verified. The files are in `out/<lang>/`:

| File | Size |
|---|---|
| `fastpitch-<lang>.int8.onnx` | ~63 MB |
| `hifigan-<lang>.int8.onnx` | ~22 MB |
| `fastpitch-<lang>.tokens.json` | ~1 KB |

Listen to `out/hi/sample-hi.wav` and `out/en/sample-en.wav` to judge voice quality
before putting these on a phone.

**SHA-256** (recorded so the Model Manager can verify a published download):

```

## 2. Put the models on a phone

Nothing needs rebuilding — the app picks these up at runtime.

1. Connect the phone and confirm it is visible:
   ```
   adb devices
   ```
2. Install the app once, so its storage directory exists:
   ```
   adb install -r ../app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   ```
3. Create the model folders:
   ```
   adb shell mkdir -p /sdcard/Android/data/com.itantra/files/models/hi
   adb shell mkdir -p /sdcard/Android/data/com.itantra/files/models/en
   ```
4. Push the STT models (download them first — see §3) and the TTS models:
   ```
   adb push out/hi/. /sdcard/Android/data/com.itantra/files/models/hi/
   adb push out/en/. /sdcard/Android/data/com.itantra/files/models/en/
   ```
5. Confirm what landed:
   ```
   adb shell ls -l /sdcard/Android/data/com.itantra/files/models/hi
   ```
6. Open the app → **Language Packs**. Hindi and English should read "Ready".
7. Watch the pipeline while testing:
   ```
   adb logcat -s SttManager IndicConformerStt TtsManager FastPitchTts AudioOutput SileroVad
   ```

The `.wav` files in `out/` are samples only — do not push them.

## 3. STT models (no export needed)

Per-language int8 ONNX exports of the AI4Bharat IndicConformer weights are already
published under Apache-2.0 at
`parismitaglobalsolutions/indicconformer-sherpa-onnx`, and their URLs and checksums are
already filled into `app/src/main/assets/models/manifest.json`. Download them from inside
the app (Language Packs → Download), or fetch manually:

```
B=https://huggingface.co/parismitaglobalsolutions/indicconformer-sherpa-onnx/resolve/main
curl -4 -L -o out/hi/indicconformer-hi.int8.onnx  $B/hi/model.int8.onnx
curl -4 -L -o out/hi/indicconformer-hi.tokens.txt $B/tokens.txt
curl -4 -L -o out/en/indicconformer-en.int8.onnx  $B/en/model.int8.onnx
curl -4 -L -o out/en/indicconformer-en.tokens.txt $B/en/tokens.txt
```

> Use `curl -4`. This machine resolved `huggingface.co` to IPv6-only addresses that stall.

Available: `as bn en gu hi kn ml mr pa ta te`. **Odia has no published STT export** — it is
the one gap in the ten languages.

## 4. Exporting another language

Each language pack is a ~1.45 GB download.

1. Fetch the checkpoint (`or`, `gu`, `mr`, `kn`, `ml`, `ta`, `te`, `bn`):
   ```
   L=ta
   curl -4 -L --retry 5 -o checkpoints/$L.zip \
     https://github.com/AI4Bharat/Indic-TTS/releases/download/v1-checkpoints-release/$L.zip
   ```
2. Extract and export:
   ```
   unzip -q -o checkpoints/$L.zip -d extracted/
   ./ttsenv/bin/python export_tts.py --lang $L --ckpt-root extracted --out out
   ```
3. Verify it makes sound, in that language's script:
   ```
   ./ttsenv/bin/python verify_tts.py --dir out/$L --lang $L --text "<a sentence>"
   ```
4. Record the checksums for the manifest:
   ```
   sha256sum out/$L/*
   ```
5. Reclaim ~1.6 GB:
   ```
   rm -rf extracted/$L checkpoints/$L.zip
   ```

`--speaker-id` selects the voice: **0 = female, 1 = male** (both are trained in every
pack). The default is 0.

## 5. Environment

Built once, already present in `ttsenv/`. To recreate:

```
python3 -m venv ttsenv
./ttsenv/bin/pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
./ttsenv/bin/pip install "coqui-tts[codec]" "transformers<5" numpy onnx onnxruntime onnxscript
```

Three pins matter, each learned the hard way:

- **`transformers<5`** — coqui-tts imports XTTS → tortoise → `isin_mps_friendly`, which
  transformers 5.x removed.
- **`coqui-tts[codec]`** — torch ≥ 2.9 needs torchcodec for audio IO.
- **CPU torch** — this machine has an AMD integrated GPU, so the CUDA wheels are ~2 GB of
  dead weight. Export is a one-shot graph trace; it takes about a minute per model on CPU.

## 6. Notes on the export itself

Three things in `export_tts.py` exist for non-obvious reasons; leave them in place.

- **FastPitch must use the dynamo exporter** (`dynamo=True`). The `fftransformer` encoder
  is built on `torch.nn.MultiheadAttention`, which bakes the traced sequence length into a
  Reshape under the legacy TorchScript tracer. The result loads fine and then fails at
  runtime on any sentence that is not exactly the dummy length. Symptom:
  `input_shape_size == requested_shape_size was false ... requested shape:{24,1,512}`.
- **`PositionalEncoding.forward` is patched** to drop its `max_len` guard. That guard is a
  data-dependent comparison which aborts `torch.export`, and it cannot fire for any real
  utterance.
- **Mel orientation is probed eagerly**, not branched on inside `forward`. Coqui emits
  `[B, T, 80]` and HiFi-GAN wants `[B, 80, T]`; testing `mel.shape[1] != 80` inside the
  traced function is another data-dependent guard.

HiFi-GAN stays on the legacy tracer, which handles it without complaint.

The two stages are exported separately rather than fused, matching the app's two-stage
`TtsEngine`: the vocoder is the expensive half and the most likely thing to be swapped or
requantised later.

## 7. Translation (IndicTrans2)

Hindi ↔ English only — the two languages with real STT and TTS today.

**No export was needed.** MIT-licensed ONNX conversions of AI4Bharat's distilled 200M
IndicTrans2 are published by `TigreGotico`, and the graph contract was read off the models
themselves rather than taken from the README:

```
encoder  input_ids [B,S] i64, attention_mask [B,S] i64  ->  last_hidden_state [B,S,512]
decoder  input_ids [B,T] i64, encoder_attention_mask [B,S] i64,
         encoder_hidden_states [B,S,512]                ->  logits [B,T,V] (+72 KV tensors)
```

`decoder_start_token_id=2`, `eos=2`, `pad=1`, max source 256 tokens.

### Which direction goes on which phone

Translation happens **on receive**, into the reader's own language, so a phone needs only
one direction — the one *into* the language it is set to. Files therefore live in the
**target** language's pack directory:

| Phone set to | Needs | Lives in | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| English | Hindi → English | `models/en/` | 226 MB |
| Hindi | English → Hindi | `models/hi/` | 270 MB |

### Rebuild the vocab files

The ONNX repos ship a SentencePiece model plus a separate graph dictionary whose ids do
**not** match SentencePiece's internal ids. `export_mt_vocab.py` joins them into one flat
TSV the Kotlin tokeniser reads without a native SentencePiece dependency, and writes the
FLORES language-tag ids — which differ between directions (`hin_Deva` is 8 one way and 15
the other) and must never be hardcoded.

```
./ttsenv/bin/python export_mt_vocab.py --dir mt/indic-en
./ttsenv/bin/python export_mt_vocab.py --dir mt/en-indic
```

### Check a direction actually translates

```
./ttsenv/bin/python translate_onnx.py --dir mt/indic-en --src hi --tgt en \
  --text "यहाँ भूकंप आया है, तीन लोग घायल हैं"
```

This drives the same greedy loop the app does. Read the output — the point is the
translation, not the exit code.

### Put them on a phone

```
adb push mt/staged/en/. /sdcard/Android/data/com.itantra/files/models/en/
adb push mt/staged/hi/. /sdcard/Android/data/com.itantra/files/models/hi/
adb logcat -s TranslationManager IndicTrans2
```

### Known limits

- **Greedy decoding, no KV cache.** `decoder_model.onnx` re-runs the whole prefix each
  step, so decoding is O(n²) in output length. Switching to `decoder_with_past_model.onnx`
  is the first optimisation if latency hurts; it is a speed fix, not a correctness one.
- **No IndicNLP normalisation.** The reference pipeline runs an Indic normaliser and entity
  placeholders before SentencePiece; this does NFKC only. Fine for the phrasings tested,
  unverified for unusual orthography.
- **Hindi and English only.** The other eight languages have no MT model here, and
  `TranslationManager` reports that honestly rather than passing text through pretending.
